    Hello to you all, I'm glad you found this. I am from Lagos, Nigeria. The
    weather over here is usually wonderful
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently I am studying to earn a Bachelor of Science degree in Software
    development. I love technology, especially coding. Building websites,
    scripting and gaining new technical skills. When I am not coding or
    learning, I love to go for long lone walks, try out new foods, and
    listen to good music (My favorite musician is Burna boy from Nigeria).
  </p>
  <p>
    I also enjoy meeting new people. I welcome getting to know you all. Thank
    you for looking at my webpage
